<p>Selcouth Cycles–a name that intimates the unusual and marvelous nature of the wheel and bicycle builds that will abound–is a custom wheel building and bicycle repair operation in Denver, Colorado. Kohl Kinning’s interest formalized when he joined the Bicycle CO-OP at his undergrad, Lewis &amp; Clark College, where he learned repair techniques from other members, some of whom were part-time bicycle mechanics. He would end up leading the organization as his education came to a close. Immediately after college, he would join Sellwood Cycle Repair and rise from a dedicated parts cleaner to a full-fledged mechanic in short time, learning through persistent pestering of colleagues while they repaired customers’ bicycles. His career path would take him to a different field altogether, but personal projects and the repair of friends and family’s bicycles would continue. Inspired by friends’ interest in his unusual and well-executed combination of vintage styling with top-of-the-line components, Kohl would see a business opportunity and would expand his work to a customer base wider than just friends and family.</p>
